    "1. Most Effective Programs for Placement:\n",
    "- Advanced Excel for Analysts, Communication & Soft Skills, Cybersecurity Foundations, and SQL for Beginners each led to the highest number of job placements (19–22 each).\n",
    "- Full Stack Web Development also performed well, though with slightly fewer placements (13).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Salary Outcomes:\n",
    "- Communication & Soft Skills graduates had the highest average and median salaries (avg: 158,516; median: 180,455), suggesting strong employer demand and/or higher-value roles. - Advanced Excel for Analysts, Cybersecurity Foundations, and Full Stack Web Development also resulted in strong salary outcomes (median salaries above 140,000).\n",

    "3. Speed to Employment:\n",
    "- Full Stack Web Development and Communication & Soft Skills had the shortest median time to employment (272 days), meaning graduates from these programs found jobs faster than others. - Cybersecurity Foundations had the longest median time to employment (533 days), indicating it may take longer for those graduates to secure a job, despite good salary outcomes.\n",

    "Overall Inference:\n",
    "- Training programs in Excel, Communication, and Web Development are highly effective for both job placement and salary, with relatively quick transitions to employment. - Cybersecurity Foundations, while strong in placement and salary, may require more patience for jobseekers before landing a role. - These insights can help GTS prioritize and promote the most impactful training programs, and set realistic expectations for jobseekers regarding time-to-employment."

    "• Completing training programs leads to higher skill ratings, especially in external (employer/third-party) evaluations. \n",
    "• Programs in Soft Skills and Cybersecurity yield the highest placement rates and salaries; content area matters more than duration or delivery type.\n",
    "• Certification rates and trainer ratings are highest in programs with strong structure and support, but high certification does not always mean high employability.\n",
    "• Training type (full-time, part-time, self-paced) and duration have little impact on employability or salary outcomes. \n",
    "• Correlation analysis shows program content/focus is the main driver of jobseeker success, not duration, cost, or certification rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations\n",
    "• Prioritize and expand high-impact programs (Soft Skills, Cybersecurity, Data/Analytics). \n",
    "• Review and improve programs with low certification rates or trainer ratings, focusing on content clarity and trainer support. \n",
    "• Personalize training recommendations for jobseekers based on their skill gaps, interests, and career goals. \n",
    "• Encourage program completion through better support, motivation, and recognition, as completion is strongly linked to employability. \n",
    "• Monitor and iterate on program content, using feedback and outcome data to drive continuous improvement.\n"
